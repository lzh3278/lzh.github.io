About My Research
------
My research interest is the complex system of environment-energy-economy in both macro and individual prespectives. At present, I am delving into several exciting topics:
* Household water-energy nexus and managements on its related resource consumption and wastewater generation.
* The decision-making mechanism of individual environmental behaviors and the impact of communities on the decisions.
* Computing in energy and environment using machine learning algorithms.
  
I am passionate about using my skills and knowledge to contribute to creating a sustainable future, and I believe that these research areas hold significant promise in this regard.
