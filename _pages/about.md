Hello! I am Zonghan Li, a master student studying environmental planning and management at Tsinghua University.

My research interest is the complex system of environment-energy-economy in both macro and individual prespectives. At present, I am delving into several exciting topics
* Household water-energy nexus and managements on its related resource consumption and wastewater generation,
* The decision-making mechanism of individual environmental behaviors and the impact of communities on the decisions,
* Environment computing using machine learning algorithms.
