Abstract
------
Under continuous pressures of urban water and energy use, the synergistic management of water and energy is gradually attracting the attention of policymakers. Compared to the centralized sources such as industry and agriculture where control objectives and paths are clear, household water and energy consumptions are more scattered and complicated. To formulate more suitable conservation policies, it is vital to understand the situation of each household, where the differences in water-use electric appliances contribute significantly to the differences in water and energy consumption.
This thesis focuses on the changes in the characteristics of household water-use electric appliances and takes the amount and intensity of water-related energy consumption as the basic perspective. Multi-source data acquisition and processing techniques including web crawlers and SQL databases are firstly employed to integrate micro household social surveys, appliance sales and characteristics data and establish a multi-source dataset of characteristics of household water-using electrical appliances for cleaning, bathing and cooking behaviors (MWEA). Based on the multi-source dataset and econometric models, the trends of changes in appliance characteristics and their macro socio-economic drivers are analyzed and quantified; Using Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis, the impact of changes in appliance characteristics on water consumption are quantified by taking cleaning behavior as an example. The conclusions of this thesis may facilitate policy decisions on the synergistic management of household water and energy.
Results show that: (1) from 2012 to 2019, the characteristics of China's household water-using electric appliances develop towards energy and water saving directions: the water consumptions of cleaning appliances weighted by sales decrease year by year, and the energy consumptions first decrease and then rise; the water consumptions of cooking appliances fluctuate slightly and the energy consumption decrease year by year; the average energy efficiency levels of gas water heaters (bathing appliances) first rise, then decrease and finally stabilize, and the average energy efficiency levels of electric water heaters rise first and then gradually smooth out. (2) Prices and population are the driving factors for the change of appliance characteristics. The increase in regional prices and urbanization rate promote positive changes in the characteristics of pulsator washing machines and have a suppressive effect on platen washing machines. And the increase in population growth rate and the percentage of adults significantly pull the positive changes in the characteristics of platen washing machines and the reverse changes in pulsator washing machines. The difference in the direction of changes between the two is mainly due to the difference in price, market sales and the distribution of energy efficiency levels of sold appliances. (3) The total amount and intensity of household water consumption is influenced by the characteristics of water-use electric appliances. The combined effect of the renewal rate of appliances for cleaning behavior, the penetration rate of energy-efficiency labels, and the year of renewal will bring the highest 48.2% increase in water consumption energy intensity and 9.8% decrease in water consumption. While it will increase the water consumption energy. The water consumption energy for bathing and cooking behavior will gradually decrease between 2012 and 2019, which will reduce the water consumption energy intensity. Accordingly, policy implications can be provided to relevant departments: (1) dynamically adjust energy and water efficiency standards and delineate the red line of market access for electrical appliance features; (2) give more R&D support to energy-saving and water-saving appliances, subsidize different kinds of energy-saving (water-saving) appliances and different purchasing groups in different degrees and ways.
