Abstract
-----
To improve energy-saving management, the energy efficiency grade (EEG) was introduced by the Chinese government in the 2000s and implemented for white goods (WGs) in early stages. However, due to the lack of actual statistics, how effective the promotion of high EEG WGs has been in China is still not clear. The China Energy Efficiency Grade (CEEG) dataset for WGs described here comprises (i) EEG-related data on 5 kinds of WGs at regional (national, provincial) and household levels in China and (ii) predictions of future average EEG trends. By web crawling, retrieving and processing in SQL, the average EEG data weighted by sales in 30 provinces in mainland China from 2012 to 2019 are provided. Household WG survey data, including household information and average EEG, were collected by distributing questionnaires to 1327 households in Beijing, China. The CEEG dataset will facilitate the advancement of research on household energy consumption, household appliance consumer choice, and the assessment of energy efficiency-related policies.
